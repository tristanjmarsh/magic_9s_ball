Youâ€™ll thank yourself later.", "Signs point to yes, and so do I.", "Locked in. That's a yes.","Yeah, that checks out.","Affirmative. I ran the numbers. Literally.", "Correct. That aligns with canonical sources.", "Confirmed. Even Spock would nod silently.", "Indeed. The logic is sound and peer-reviewed.", "Yes, and actually, thatâ€™s supported by three independent simulations.", "You got it â€” and not just anecdotally. Empirically.", "Yes, assuming standard Earth gravity and no quantum interference.", "By the laws of thermodynamicsâ€¦ yes.", "Affirmative, assuming no one changes the timeline again.", "I already calculated that outcome â€” 97.3 percent favorable.",

        "Hmm... could go either way.", "Hard to say. Ask again after coffee.", "Not sure â€” try flipping a coin.", "Possibly. But don't quote me.", "Unclear. Try rephrasing or divining.", "Eh, 50/50.", "That depends on more than you think.", "I'm not touching that one. Yet.", "Itâ€™s in the realm of possibility.", "You might need a second opinion.", "Unclear. Need to rerun the analysis with fewer assumptions.", "Hmm. That depends. Are we talking pre- or post-reboot continuity?", "The probability curve is inconclusive without more data points.", "I'd have to consult the codex... and probably a therapist.", "It's a nonzero chance â€” but dangerously close to zero.", "Maybe, but Iâ€™d want to roll with advantage.", "That's debatable. Depends if you're using house rules.", "Iâ€™d label that as a Schrodinger's Maybe.", "It's plausible, though I'd like to see a footnote.", "Ambiguous. Like the ending of *Inception* but nerdier.",

Probably not tomorrow either.", "The outlook is grim.", "Ask again later â€” or donâ€™t. Itâ€™s still a no.", "Let it go. Seriously.", "Incorrect. And I say that with encyclopedic confidence.", "Thatâ€™s a no â€” unless you're playing on Easy Mode.", "Negative. Even the Kobayashi Maru had better odds.", "Nope. Not even with the Infinity Gauntlet.", "Yeah, that violates both physics *and* canon.", "Absolutely not. Iâ€™ve seen fanfics with more realism.", "No. And if you reread Appendix C, you'd know why.", "Declined. Iâ€™m not even rolling for that.", "Negative. I ran the simulation 10,000 times â€” never works.", "That idea's worse than Jar Jar Binks in a leadership role."]
