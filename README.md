# 🎱 Magic 9S-Ball

A nerdy, hyper-literal, pop culture-saturated spin on the classic Magic 8-Ball — now in web app form! Built with Python and Streamlit, this app delivers affirmative, neutral, and negative responses steeped in geekery: from Star Trek and D&D to grammar corrections and quantum mechanics.

## 🤔 What is This?

**Magic 9S-Ball** (the 'S' stands for "semantic") is an AI-ish response generator built for:

- Trekkies 🖖
- Trivia snobs 🧠
- Dungeon masters 🐉
- Sci-fi theorists 🚀
- And your favorite IT friend who won't stop correcting your grammar.

You ask a question. It answers — sometimes helpfully, sometimes snarkily, always nerdily.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   You only need Streamlit:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run Magic_9S_Ball_app.py
   ```

3. **Ask a question**
   Watch the magic happen. Or don’t. The app probably has a snarky response for that too.
